The scripts in this repository enable automatically downloading, frame extracting and annotation processing of the original RAT7M release.

We also offer additional instructions for generating training and test dataset from the massive amount of availble frames, same as the ones used in [Geometric deep learning enables 3D kinematic profiling across species and environments (Dunn et al. 2021, Nat Methods)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01106-6).
